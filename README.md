# Real_Estate_Regression
## Predicting the selling price of a residential property using regression analysis.
Predicting the selling price of a residential property depends on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location.

In this challenge, you will use a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on its features. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.

## The Dataset
The data consists of the following variables:

- **transaction_date** - the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)
- **house_age** - the house age (in years)
- **transit_distance** - the distance to the nearest light rail station (in meters)
- **local_convenience_stores** - the number of convenience stores within walking distance
- **latitude** - the geographic coordinate, latitude
- **longitude** - the geographic coordinate, longitude
- **price_per_unit** - house price of unit area (3.3 square meters)

## Task
The dataset will be explored and prepared for analysis, predictive features that will help predict the price_per_unit label wil be identified and selected, and a regression model that achieves the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which must be less than 7 when evaluated against a test subset of data will be trained and evaluated with the training subset data.
